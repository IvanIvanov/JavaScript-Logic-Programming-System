          Programs written for the logic programming system are 
          composed of a sequence of elements called terms. There 
          are 3 different kinds of terms:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>Atoms</strong>: these are general purpose names with no
            inherent meaning. Atoms are strings that start with lowercase 
            letters and can contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters and 
            underscores. Example atoms include: natural, fooBar, foo_bar.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Variables</strong>: resemble variables in logic in that 
            they are placeholders for arbitrary terms. They are denoted by 
            strings that start with an uppercase letter and can contain 
            lowercase letters, uppercase letters and underscores. 
            Example Variables include: X, Y, Foo, Foo_bar.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Compound Terms</strong>: are composed from an atom called a 
            functor and a number of arguments, which are again terms. Compound 
            terms are written as a functor followed by a comma-separated list 
            of argument terms, which is contained in parentheses.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          Top level compound terms can be of 1 of 3 types determined by the 
          value of their functor:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>fact</strong> - a compound term of arity 1, where the first
            argument is a term to be added to the system's database. Example 
            facts include: fact(likes(fred, wilma)), fact(plus(two, two, four)).
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>rule</strong> - a compound term of arity 2, where the first
            argument is the head of the rule and the second argument is the 
            body of the rule. Example rules include: 
            rule(natural(succ(X)), natural(X)), 
            rule(likes(X, Y), and(likes(X, Z), likes(Z, Y)).
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>query</strong> - a compound term of arity 1, where the first
            argument is a goal term that the system must try to resolve, by 
            finding appropriate values for the variables. Example queries 
            include: query(likes(fred, X)), query(natural(succ(succ(zero)))).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          The system supports 3 special forms for logic operations which are
          represented by compound terms with functors:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>and</strong> - a compound term of arity n, which dictates 
            that all the arguments have to simultaniously resolve for the 
            whole term to resolve successfully.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>or</strong> - a compound term of arity n, which dictates
            that at least one of the arguments must successfully resolve for 
            the whole term to resolve successfully.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>not</strong> - a compound term of arity 1, which dictates
            that at the term resolves successfully if the argument can not resolve.
            </li>
          </ol>
